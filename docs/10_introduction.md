# Introduction

This is the official repository for Fullerton College's Applied Engineering Club (AEC) UAV Project (2024). Welcome applied engineers!

## What's the UAV Project?

The UAV Project is Fullerton College's entry into a design, simulation, and flight competition with other schools. AEC members have decided to submit a VTOL (vertical take off landing) Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV).

## Why should I Participate?

Participating in clubs gives students the experience needed to build resumes and stand out from the competition when applying for universities or jobs. Additionally it builds lifelong skills and friends that are intrinsically valuable.

## How do I Get More Involved?

Due to the public nature of the internet, this information is limited to Fullerton College students only. Team Leaders for the UAV Project should be contacted for details.

## Where Can I Learn More?

The club discord and in person primarily. See answer above.
