# Mechanical Team

The mechanical team works with the physical components, electronics, and 3D design of our VTOL UAV, etc.

Here's our current [model](https://a360.co/3ufcpI2)

We may or may not be covering mission planning on this team.

This is our [components](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tah2RrGbtXM58vIQXKMKE_LqVQVQTJHqW0JtdlxkLvY/edit?usp=sharing) list.

We will be running PX4 Autopilot on the Pixhawk (with missions uploaded at the least).

It will be connected to a Raspberry Pi running ROS with ROS nodes for Obstacle Avoidance and Target Detection using [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) as a [companion computer](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/companion_computer/).
