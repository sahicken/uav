# Obstacle Avoidance

[check out its github](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Avoidance/tree/master)

We will need to figure out a way to commuicate a 3D Point Cloud (i.e. [sensor_msgs::PointCloud2](https://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/PointCloud2.html)) with our sensors (Camera and perhaps an ultrasonic sensor) and ROS nodes. One idea is [Rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/Camera). [Research nodes please!](https://index.ros.org/)
